Welcome! In this video, we'll break down the K-Means algorithm,

2
00:00:04,794 --> 00:00:09,717
a popular method for clustering data. Let's start by understanding

3
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:14,132
the overall idea of grouping similar data points together.

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,774
The first step in K-Means is initialization, where we select K

5
00:00:18,874 --> 00:00:23,676
random points to serve as the initial centroids for our clusters.

6
00:00:23,733 --> 00:00:26,761
Next, every data point is assigned to the

7
00:00:26,861 --> 00:00:31,567
nearest centroid based on distance, effectively forming initial

8
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:35,153
clusters. This is known as the assignment step.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,739
After assigning points, we compute new centroids by taking the

10
00:00:39,839 --> 00:00:43,929
mean of all points within each cluster. This update step

11
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:47,820
moves the centroids to the center of their clusters.

12
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:51,389
The algorithm iterates through the assignment and

13
00:00:51,489 --> 00:00:54,493
update steps until the centroids no longer

14
00:00:54,593 --> 00:00:59,742
change significantly, indicating convergence and well-defined clusters.
